# Project 2

## Overview
This project consists of several JavaScript functions that perform calculations and checks related to everyday problem-solving, including pizza price-per-square-inch calculations, numeric validation, leap year checks, and determining the number of days in a month.  
It demonstrates function creation, loops, conditional statements, and date manipulation in JavaScript.

## Skills Learned
- Writing and calling JavaScript functions
- Using mathematical formulas in code
- Implementing `while` loops for validation checks
- Applying `switch` statements for multiple conditional branches
- Using `if` statements to handle special cases (e.g., leap years)
- Working with the `Date` object in JavaScript
- Logging and formatting output with `console.log()` and `.toFixed()`

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
