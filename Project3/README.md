# Project 3

## Overview
This project implements several JavaScript functions that cover factorial calculation, random number generation, and a computer-based number guessing game. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic probability concepts.

## Skills Learned
- Implementing `for` loops and `do...while` loops
- Using conditional logic (`if`, `else if`, `else`) for control flow
- Creating reusable JavaScript functions
- Generating random integers within a range using `Math.random()`
- Simulating repeated trials to calculate averages
- Logging output and formatted strings to the console

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
