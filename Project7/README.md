# Project 7 – Favorite Music Prompt Collector

## Overview
This project prompts the user to input their favorite music details — artist, song, and year — repeatedly until they choose to stop. The collected data is then displayed on the webpage and logged in the console in a formatted style.

## Skills Learned
- Collecting multiple user inputs with prompts inside loops
- Storing user inputs in an array of objects dynamically
- Validating and parsing input data types (e.g., integers for year)
- Using nested loops to format and display collected data
- Manipulating the DOM to dynamically update HTML content
- Combining JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for interactive webpages

## How It Works
1. The `startup()` function initializes a configuration array defining prompt questions and data types.
2. It prompts the user for artist, song, and year using this configuration.
3. User responses are stored as objects inside an array.
4. The user is repeatedly asked if they want to add more entries.
5. The collected data is displayed in the page’s `#output` div, formatted with labels and line breaks.
6. The same output is also logged to the browser console for verification.
