# Project 8 – Buttons and Mouse Event Dynamics

## Overview
This project demonstrates handling user interactions with buttons and mouse events on a webpage. It tracks button clicks, changes background colors randomly, and monitors mouse position and clicks — dynamically displaying data on the page and logging it in the console.

## Skills Learned
- Adding event listeners for buttons and mouse events
- Handling button clicks with callback functions
- Changing DOM styles dynamically (background color)
- Tracking mouse movement and clicks with event handlers
- Creating and appending DOM elements programmatically
- Using arrays to store event-related data (mouse click positions)
- Integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS for interactive UI

## How It Works
1. The **Click Me** button increments a click counter displayed on the page.
2. The **Change Background Color** button changes the page background to a random color from a predefined palette.
3. Moving the mouse over the page updates the current mouse position (X/Y coordinates) in real-time.
4. Clicking anywhere on the page stores the click position and appends it to a list shown on the page.
5. All mouse click positions are also logged in the browser console.
